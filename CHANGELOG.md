# RayLink Changelog

## 0.2.31 - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Loon subscriptions now emit the current `sni` TLS option for VMess, VLESS,
  Trojan, AnyTLS, and Hysteria 2 nodes. IP dial endpoints therefore retain the
  Host certificate identity instead of failing TLS validation in Loon.

## 0.2.30 - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- Host identity now remains a domain in stored and rendered configurations while
  RayLink resolves and health-checks its current IPv4 dial endpoint through
  trusted DNS with TTL caching.
- Universal subscriptions adapt the resolved endpoint per client: Mihomo keeps
  the domain with a pinned hosts mapping and Fake-IP exclusion, sing-box uses a
  dedicated hosts resolver, and Loon/Egern dial the IP while retaining TLS SNI.
- Endpoint resolution persists the last-known-good address and falls back to the
  installation public IP when DNS or health checks are unavailable.

## 0.2.29 - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Local Host client subscriptions can publish a validated public IP as the
  dial address while preserving the Host domain and protocol TLS SNI, avoiding
  Fake-IP loops when clients resolve the node server through their tunnel.
- Fresh installs and upgrades persist the local Host dial IP automatically;
  failed upgrades restore the previous environment file together with the
  application, data, and service unit.

## 0.2.28 - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Loon links in the subscription API, administrator console, user portal, and
  browser landing page now use the clean universal URL without a format query
  or filename suffix. Loon User-Agent negotiation selects the native node
  format automatically.
- Centralized subscription aliases, path suffixes, User-Agent priority, portal
  aliases, and generated URLs in one server-side client format catalog.

## 0.2.27 - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Added a native Loon node subscription to the universal user URL, including
  explicit `format=loon`, Loon User-Agent negotiation, and client links in the
  administrator console and user portal.
- Loon exports compatible Shadowsocks, VMess, VLESS, Trojan, AnyTLS, and
  Hysteria 2 nodes while omitting TUIC and legacy Hysteria nodes that would
  invalidate the subscription.

## 0.2.26 - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Unified Mihomo and Egern adaptive fallback with server health admission:
  healthy UDP is preferred on suitable networks and automatically falls back
  to TCP, while unhealthy UDP remains available only in explicit UDP/manual
  groups.
- Protocol groups are now emitted only when they contain matching protocols,
  preventing UDP-only subscriptions from exposing a misleading TCP group.
- Local domains, loopback, private networks, link-local ranges, and CGNAT are
  resolved locally and bypass the proxy consistently in Mihomo, Egern, and
  sing-box full configurations.
- Egern smart selection now applies the same TCP stability preference to
  Shadowsocks as the other TCP protocols.

## 0.2.25 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Restored a shared frontend text-update helper so the post-login bootstrap can
  render the routing workspace instead of surfacing `setText is not defined`.
- Added a regression test that executes the real routing-policy renderer used
  immediately after administrator login.

## 0.2.24 - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added one persisted routing policy with smart split routing, global proxy,
  and direct modes shared by Mihomo, Egern, and sing-box subscriptions.
- Added validated custom domain, domain-suffix, IP, and CIDR rules with
  direct, proxy, AI proxy, block, and DNS behaviors.
- Added an explainable domain-routing diagnostic that reports DNS answers,
  matched policy source, and the selected outbound without pretending to
  measure the user's local network.

### Fixed

- Mihomo now resolves real addresses before its China GeoIP rule, preventing
  Fake-IP answers from forcing China-hosted domains through the proxy.
- DNS behavior now follows the selected routing mode consistently across all
  full client configuration formats.
- Demo data uses durable future expirations so release verification does not
  change as calendar dates pass.

## 0.2.23 - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Removed the age-based online database backup warning so an older backup that
  still passes its integrity check no longer creates a false operational alert.
- Preserved separate alerts for a missing backup and a backup that fails its
  SQLite integrity check.

## 0.2.22 - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Removed the standalone Operations workspace and moved Runtime status into
  System Hosts, with publishing, rollback, and Deployment history under
  System maintenance.
- Added Host-scoped diagnostics with refreshable Runtime, protocol,
  Deployment application, and Runtime-eligible User checks.
- Preserved legacy Operations links by redirecting them to the new publishing
  and rollback workspace.

## 0.2.21 - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Mihomo smart, fallback and manual policies now expose every eligible enabled
  protocol; the UDP policy also includes Hysteria alongside Hysteria 2 and TUIC.
- Mihomo TLS exports use the protocol-correct SNI field, and TUIC exports include
  bounded heartbeat and connection timeouts.
- Health checks use separate smart, TCP and UDP budgets so unreliable UDP paths
  do not slow TCP failover.

## 0.2.20 - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Subscription delivery now uses a compact two-column client picker in both
  the administrator drawer and user portal.
- Clash/Mihomo is presented as the recommended import while Egern full-profile
  and node-only imports remain clearly separated.

## 0.2.19 - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Online SQLite backups now remove temporary WAL and shared-memory sidecars
  after successful creation.
- The next backup automatically cleans temporary SQLite files left by an
  interrupted previous backup, preventing unbounded backup-directory growth.

## 0.2.18 - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Release verification now respects root-owned protocol Runtime artifacts and
  verifies the pinned Cronet companion checksum before protocol acceptance.
- Memory soak checks use a bounded keep-alive client pool, separating server
  memory behavior from Node.js client socket allocation high-water marks.

## 0.2.17 - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Unified routing policy exported consistently to sing-box, Mihomo and Egern.
- Deployment Target status and atomic remote task claiming for multi-Host rollout.
- Owner, Operator, Support and Auditor roles with mutation audit events.
- Online SQLite backup, verified restore tooling and pre-upgrade migration checks.
- Protocol health windows using P50, P95, MAD jitter and TCP/UDP stability admission.
- Webhook alerts for Host, Deployment, protocol, metering, memory, disk, certificate and backup health.
- Native Linux AMD64 and ARM64 release pipelines with SHA-256 manifests, SPDX SBOMs and GitHub build provenance.

### Changed

- RayLink Node telemetry now reports disk capacity in addition to CPU, memory, network and Runtime state.
- Official one-command installation accepts both Linux AMD64 and ARM64 release packages.
- Approved Linux Runtime packages now include the pinned Cronet companion required for real Naive protocol probes, including checksums, rollback and SBOM metadata.
